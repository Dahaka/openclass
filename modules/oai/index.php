 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * This is an implementation for an OAI-PMH 2.0 Data Provider (sometimes, repository is used exchangeablly) written in PHP.
 *
 * This implementation completely complies to OAI-PMH 2.0, including
 * the support of on-the-fly output compression which may significantly
 * reduce the amount of data being transfered.
 *
 * This package has been inspired by PHP OAI Data Provider developed by Heinrich Stamerjohanns at University of Oldenburg.  
 * Some of the functions and algorithms used in this code were transplanted from his  implementation at http://physnet.uni-oldenburg.de/oai/.
 *
 * Database support is supported through PDO (PHP Data Objects included in 
 * the PHP distribution), so almost any popular SQL-database can be 
 * used without any change in the code. Only thing need to do is to configure
 * database connection and define a suitable data structure.
 *
 * The repository can be quite easily configured by just editing 
 * oaidp-config.php, most possible values and options are explained.
 *
 * \section req_sec Requirements
 * - A running web server + PHP version 5.0 or above.
 * - A databse can be connected by PDO. 
 *
 * \section install_sec Installation
 *
 * - Copy the the files in source package to a location under your
 * 	 document root of your web server. The directory structure should be
 * 	 preserved. 
 * - Change to that directory (e.g. cd /var/www/html/oai).
 * - Allow your webserver to write to the token directory.
 * 	 The default token directory is /tmp which does not need any attention.
 * - Edit oaidp-config.php. Almost all possible options are 
 * 	 explained. It is assumed that basic elements of a record are stored in 
 * 	 one simple table. You can find sql examples of table definition in doc folder.
 * 	 If your data is organized differently, you have to adjust the <i>Query</i> functions 
 *  to reflect it and even develop your own code.
 * - Check your oai site through a web browser. e.g. : \code http://localhost/oai/ \endcode
 * - SELinux needs special treatments for database connection and other permission.
 *
 * \section struct_sec Structure
  The system includes files for individual functionality and utility classes and functions to get it work.
  - Controller
  - oai2.php
  - Individual functionalities:
  - identify.php: identifies the data provider. Responses to <B>Identify</B>.
  - listmetadataformats.php: lists supported metadata formats, e.g. dc or rif-cs. Responses to <B>ListMetadataFormats</B>.
  - listsets.php: lists supported sets, e.g. Activity, Collection or Party. Responses to <B>ListSets</B>.
  - listrecords.php: lists a group of records without details. Responses to <B>ListRecords</B>. It also serves to <B>ListIdentifiers</B> which only returns identifiers.
  - getrecord.php: gets an individual record. Responses to <B>GetRecord</B>.
  - Utility classes
  - xml_creater.php which includes classess ANDS_XML, ANDS_Error_XML, ANDS_Response_XML
  - Utility functions
  - oaidp-util.php
  - Support to different metadataformats in your own systems. Two examples provided with the package are: record_dc.php and record_rif.php. They are helpers and need information from the real records. They need to be devloped for your particular system.
  - Configurations
  - oaidp-config.php
