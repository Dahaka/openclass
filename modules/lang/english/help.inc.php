The Learning Path tool supports four basic functionalities:
<ul>
<li>Create a Learning Path</li>
<li>Import a Scorm or IMS format Learning Path</li>
<li>Export a Scorm 2004 or 1.2 compliant Learning Path</li>
<li>Track the progress of the students following the Learning Paths</li>
</ul>

<p><b>What is a Learning Path?</b></p>
<p>A Learning Path is a sequence of learning steps included in modules. It can be
content-based (looking like a table of contents) or activities-based, looking like
an agenda or a programme of what you need to do in order to understand and practice a
certain knowledge or know-how.</p>
<p>In addition to being structured, a learning path can
also be sequenced. This means that some steps will constitute pre-requisites for the steps
after them (\"you cannot go to step 2 before step 1\"). Your sequence can only be suggestive
(steps are displayed one after the other).</p>

<p><b>How to create your own Learning Path?</b></p>
<p>The first step is to access the Learning Path module. In
the Learning Path entry page, you can select the <i>'Create a new learning path'</i> opion in order to create as many Learning Paths as you like. In this way new Learning Paths are created, that are empty till you add modules and steps to them.</p>

<p><b>What are the steps for these paths? (What are the objects that can be added?)</b></p>
<p>Some of the Eclass tools, activities and contents that you consider to be useful
and appropriate for your Learning Path can be added:</p>
<ul>
<li>Separate documents (texts, pictures, Office docs, ...)</li>
<li>Labels</li>
<li>Links</li>
<li>Eclass Exercises</li>
<li>Eclass Course Description</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Other Learning Path features</b></p>
<p>Students can be asked to follow (read) your path in a given order. This means
that for example students cannot go to Quiz 2 till they have read Document 1.
All items have a status: completed or incomplete, so the progress of students is
clearly available through the <i>Tracking</i> tool.</p>

<p>If you modify the original title of a step, the new title will appear in
the path, but the original title will not be deleted. So if you want
test8.doc to appear as 'Final Exam' in the path, you do not have to rename
the file, you can use the new title in the path. It is also useful
to give new titles to links as they are too long.</p>
<br>

<p><b>What is a Scorm or IMS format Learning path and how to upload (import) it?</b></p>
<p>The learning path tool allows you to upload SCORM and IMS compliant course
contents.</p>
<p>SCORM (<i>Sharable Content Object Reference Model</i>) is a public standard
followed by major e-Learning actors like NETg, Macromedia, Microsoft, Skillsoft,
etc. and acting at three levels:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Economy</b>: Scorm allows whole courses or small content
units to be reusable on different Learning Management Systems (LMS)
through the separation of content and context,</li>
<li><b>Pedagogy</b>: Scorm integrates the notion of
pre-requisite or <i>sequencing</i> (<i>e.g. </i>\"You
cannot go to chapter 2 before passing Quiz 1\"),</li>
<li><b>Technology</b>: Scorm generates a table of contents as
an abstraction layer situated outside content and outside the LMS. It
helps content and LMS communicate with each
other. What is communicated is mainly <i>bookmarks</i> (\"Where is John in the
course?\"), <i>scoring</i> (\"How did John pass the test?\") and <i>time</i> (\"How much
time did John spent in chapter 1?\").</li>
</ul>

<p><b>How to create a SCORM compliant learning path?</b></p>
<p>The most natural way is to use the Eclass Learning Path Builder and export it through selection of the corresponding button. 
However, you may want to create complete Scorm compliant websites locally on your own computer before uploading it
onto your eclass platform. In this case, we recommend the use of a sophisticated tool like
Lectora&reg; or Reload&reg;</p>

<p><b>Useful links</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Adlnet: authority responsible for Scorm normalisation, <a
href=\"http://www.adlnet.org/\">http://www.adlnet.org</a></li>
<li>Reload: Open Source free Scorm player and editor, <a
href=\"http://www.reload.ac.uk/\">http://www.reload.ac.uk</a></li>
<li>Lectora: Scorm publisher authoring software, <a
href=\"http://www.trivantis.com/\">http://www.trivantis.com</a></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Note:</b></p>
<p>The Learning Path section lists all the <i>self-built Learning Paths</i>
and all uploaded <i>Scorm format Learning Paths</i>, as well.</p>

<p>Selection of the 'Activation' / 'Deactivation' link moves the Learning Path to the 'Active' or 'Inactive Tools' correspondingly.</p>

<h4>Basic syntax</h4>
<p>Creating wiki pages and links between them</p>
<p><strong>Wiki words</strong>: Wiki words are words written like <em>WikiWord</em>. To create a wiki page or a link to a wiki page, edit an existing one and add the title of the page in WikiWord syntax, for example <em>MyPage</em>, then save the page. The Wiki Word <em>MyPage</em> will automatically be replaced with a link to the Wiki page <em>MyPage</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wiki links</strong>: Wiki links are like Hyperlinks (see below) apart from the fact that they do not contain any protocol scheme (like <em>http://</em> or <em>ftp://</em>) and are automatically recognized as links to Wiki pages. To create a new page or create a link to an existing one using Wiki links, edit a page and add <code>[page title]</code> or <code>[name of link|title of page]</code> to its content. You can also use this syntax to change the text of a WikiWord link : <code>[name of link|WikiWord]</code>.</p>
<ul>Hyperlinks
<li><code>[url]</code>, <code>[name|url]</code>, <code>[name|url|language]</code> or <code>[name|url|language|title]</code>.&nbsp;;</li></ul>
<ul>Image inclusion
<li><code>((url|alternate text))</code>, <code>((url|alternate text|position))</code> or <code>((url|alternate text|position|long description))</code>. <br />The position argument can take the following values: L (left), R (right) or C (center). &nbsp;
You can also use the syntax of Hyperlinks. For example <code>[title|image.gif]</code>. This syntax is deprecated, so it is better to consider using the preceding one &nbsp;</li></ul>
<ul>Link to an image
<li>same as Hyperlinks but put a 1 as the fifth argument to avoid uploading an image and get a hyperlink to the image instead. For example <code>[image|image.gif||0]</code> will display a link to image.gif instead of displaying the image itself</li></ul>
<p>Layout</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Italic</strong>: enclose your text in two straight single quotes <code>\'\'text\'\'</code>&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Bold</strong>: enclose your text in three straight single quotes <code>\'\'\'text\'\'\'</code>&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Underline</strong>: enclose your text in two underscores <code>__text__</code>&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Stroke</strong>: enclose your text in two minus symbols <code>--text--</code>&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Title</strong>: <code>!!!</code>, <code>!!</code>, <code>!</code> respectively for titles, sub-titles and sub-sub-titles&nbsp;</li>
<li>List</li>
line starting with <code>*</code> (unordered list) or <code>#</code> (ordered list). You can mix lists (<code>*#*</code>) to create multi-level lists&nbsp;
<li>Paragraph</li>
Separate paragraphs with one or more new lines&nbsp;
</ul>
<h4>Advanced syntax</h4>
<ul>
<li>Footnote</li>
<code>$$ footnote text$$</code>&nbsp;
<li>Preformatted text</li>
Begin each line of preformatted text with a blank space &nbsp;
<li>Cite block</li>
<code>&gt;</code> or <code>;:</code> before each line &nbsp;
<li>Horizontal line</li>
<code>----</code>&nbsp;
<li>Forced line break</li>
<code>%%%</code>&nbsp;
<li>Acronym</li>
<code>??acronym??</code> or <code>??acronym|definition??</code>&nbsp;

The presentation of content is made through a list box.</p>
<hr>
<h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;E-Book prerequisites (Step 1)</h2>
<p>To create a new e-book, you must create some html pages (files) that will be the e-book contents. But you must keep in mind the following rules (specifications):</p>
<ol>
  <li>Every html page must include one of the e-book subsections (this relates with the e-book navigation).</li>
  <li>The title of every html page should include the exact title of the included subsection (the titles will be used by the system for the creation of navigation links within the e-book).</li>
  <li>All html files along with their corresponding pictures and css files must be stored in a zip file.</li>
</ol>

  <li>Select the <strong>'E-Book'</strong> module</li>
  <li>Click on <strong>'Create'</strong>'
    <ul>

<p>The previous step (Step 2) displays a screen with options and a table with the html page-files you uploaded within the zip file. You can define the structure of the electronic book, as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>First define <strong>sections</strong> for the E-Book. You can add as many as you need. Define an <strong>incremental number</strong> and a <strong>name</strong> for each section in fields <strong>ID</strong> and <strong>Title</strong> correspondingly.</li>

  <li>After that you have to define the E-Book <strong>subsections</strong>. To do that you have to:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>map</strong> each uploaded page-file with the previously defined sections and</li>
      <li>define for each subsection the incremental number of the subsection within the parent section. <br />

      <em><u>Note</u>: the platform automatically suggests as title for each subsection the title of the corresponding files (these names can be modified at a later stage).</em></li>
    </ul>  
</li>
  <li>After the pagefile and section/subsection pairing is complete click on <strong>'Submit'</strong>. </li>
